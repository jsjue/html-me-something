            <h2>About The <strong>Sjue</strong> Family</h2>
                <p>It was never our intention to birth a gaggle of kids. My ability to keep hair brushed, clothes pressed and fingernails clipped deteriorated as our pair of children become a threesome. The monthly photos of child one and two, become semi-annual sessions of child three and I am not sure we have had any professional photos taken of our fourth child, who is eight now.</p>
            <h3>The <em>Organized</em> Family</h3>
                <p>Inability to keep the organized happy family look perception, gives way to meeting only the most basic perfunctory goals of clean teeth. In this way we have learned that the cleanest kid is not the happiest kid and have accepted such.</p>

            <h3>My Husband's <em>Perfectionist</em> Brother</h3>
                <p>My husband has a brother has had the last 50 years to ruminate on the imperfections around him. He and his partner have not been belabored by snotty noses, jellied fingerprints, or endless diapers. They maintain an immaculate mansion, filled with glass sculpture, white furniture, and spotless walls of windows which showcase their immaculate designer lifestyle.</p>

      <h3>Christmas Around the Fire</h3>
      <p>The desire for my husband and his brothers to assemble and reminisce about their childhood and family experiences leads them to want to spend the holidays together. My husband was the only of the three brothers who procreated at all and to such an extent as our children are easily replacing us and his siblings in terms of population control.
            Into the picturesque mansion with the million dollar pool and fabulous landscaping by a gardener of dubious origins, land the motley crew of the Sjue kids. The greeting at the 10 foot tall front door turns quickly into, “Please, do not play in the fountain” and “We have paid the gardener yesterday to clear any areas which could be of potential harm to children.” The children move wide eyed into the glistening entry where sculpture by the likes of Dale Chihouly sparkles and shines with all the luster it can manage. 
            Fast forward to the Christmas night, hot toddies and adults in front of a blazing fire and children happily watching “A Christmas Story.” Could the night be any more picture perfect? As our youngest unmonitored child enters the Hearth room holding his stomach with a painfully sour look on his face. My husband has seen this look before and immediately his shirt is removed to catch whatever will be pouring out of the sweet mouth momentarily. In the fraction of seconds the shirt takes to leave the body, the emission of all unholy projects from my child’s mouth. Cherry pie, for sure, and by the looks of it an entire pie. Did I mention the house is furnished in only white? Or that the carpet is also white? Or that unbeknownst to Michelangelo, I am sure, vomit etches marble flooring to a very dismaying degree?
            This year we will stay home for Christmas.
